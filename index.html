    <div class="section">
        <p class="section-number">1. Introduction</p>
        <p>Welcome to ChatCount, a Discord bot designed to track message activity in specific channels and reward users with roles based on their engagement. By using this bot, you agree to the following terms of service.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="section-number">2. Acceptance of Terms</p>
        <p>By adding or interacting with ChatCount, you acknowledge and agree to these terms. If you do not agree, you should stop using the bot immediately.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="section-number">3. Data Collection & Usage</p>
        <p><strong>What We Collect:</strong> ChatCount tracks and stores the number of messages each user sends in designated channels.</p>
        <p><strong>How We Use It:</strong> This data is used to provide message count statistics and assign roles based on milestones (e.g., 10,000 messages).</p>
        <p><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Only numerical message counts are stored—ChatCount does not log or save actual message content.</p>
        <p><strong>Third-Party Sharing:</strong> We do not sell, share, or distribute user data to any third party.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="section-number">4. User Responsibilities</p>
        <p>Users must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.</p>
        <p>Spam, bot abuse, or attempts to manipulate message counts may result in loss of progress, bot restrictions, or a ban.</p>
        <p>The bot should not be used for any illegal, harmful, or disruptive activities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="section-number">5. Server Owner & Admin Responsibilities</p>
        <p>Server owners and admins are responsible for managing the bot within their server and ensuring compliance with Discord’s policies.</p>
        <p>They must handle disputes related to message counts or role assignments within their community.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="section-number">6. Availability & Updates</p>
        <p>We strive to keep ChatCount online and operational but do not guarantee uninterrupted service.</p>
        <p>The bot may receive updates, including changes to features, commands, or data storage policies, at any time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="section-number">7. Limitation of Liability</p>
        <p>ChatCount is provided "as is" with no warranties or guarantees.</p>
        <p>We are not responsible for data loss, incorrect role assignments, or disruptions caused by the bot.</p>
        <p>Users and server owners use ChatCount at their own risk.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="section-number">8. Termination of Service</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to disable, remove, or ban the bot from any server without notice if misuse or violations of these terms occur.</p>
        <p>Users or servers engaging in abuse may have their access revoked permanently.</p>
    </div>
